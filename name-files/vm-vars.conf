## VM Script Parameters

# How much memory we've assigned to the VM, in kibibytes
VM_MEMORY=16777216

# Set the governor to use when the VM is on, and which
# one we should return to once the VM is shut down
VM_ON_GOVERNOR=performance
VM_OFF_GOVERNOR=performance

# Set the powerprofiles ctl profile to performance when
# the VM is on, and power-saver when the VM is shut down
VM_ON_PWRPROFILE=performance
VM_OFF_PWRPROFILE=performance

# Set which CPU's to isolate, and your system's total
# CPU's. For example, an 8-core, 16-thread processor has
# 16 CPU's to the system, numbered 0-15. For a 6-core,
# 12-thread processor, 0-11. The SYS_TOTAL_CPUS variable
# should always reflect this.
#
# You can define these as a range, a list, or both. I've
# included some examples:
#
# EXAMPLE=0-3,8-11
# EXAMPLE=0,4,8,12
# EXAMPLE=0-3,8,11,12-15
VM_ISOLATED_CPUS=0-11
SYS_TOTAL_CPUS=0-23
